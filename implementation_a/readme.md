# Requirements

In order to run this program, you'll need to have the [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) framework. 

Install the framework from the Processing organization's [website](https://processing.org/), and when Processing is installed, install Python mode.

To install Python mode, open the Processing IDE, click on the dropbox on the top right corner of the screen with the display text of "Java", and click on "Add Mode...". Click on "Python Mode for Processing 3" and click on "Install".
If the installation was successful, if you clicked on the dropbox again, you'll find the "Python" option.

# Key and Mouse Events

1. **Enter** starts, pauses, and resumes the simulation. 
2. **1** creates a Glider pattern. Only works when simulation is *not* runnning.
3. **2** creates a straight line with variable length based on the screen's size. Only works when simulation is *not* runnning.
4. **3** creates a Gosper Glider Gun pattern. Only works when simulation is *not* runnning.
5. **4** creates a Pulsar pattern. Only works when simulation is *not* runnning.
6. **c** clears the grid in the sense that all cells become dead. Only works when simulation is *not* runnning.
7. **s** saves the specific frame. Must repetitively press the button to save each frame.
